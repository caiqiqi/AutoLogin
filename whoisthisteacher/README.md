# WhoIsThisTeacher

This tool is used to crawl all the intros of every teacher in CQUPT.
- crawl all the intros as web pages
- search the teacher by typing his name

###Progress
Nearly 2 days now and I've crawled a half of the web pages.
###What has been done?
I have collected all the web pages to be crawled, so you don't need to find it yourself. And I have finished half of them.
###Core
The core is the XPath expression, which is how you tell the crawler to crawl.
###TODO
Complete the crawler and put it into a set so as to search the intro by teacher's name.
